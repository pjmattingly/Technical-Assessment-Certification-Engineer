# Technical-Assessment-Certification-Engineer

This repository fulfills the requirements for the Technical Assessment for a Server Certification - Certification Engineer position.

This repository contains two items.

The first is a PEP8 compliant Python3 script that duplicates the function of the sample script `dist_stat_test.sh` from https://code.launchpad.net/coding-samples. Note that bug fixes noted from the original code and changes from the original code are noted as comments within the script; See: `dist_stat_test.py`. Testing for this script can be found in `test_dist_stat_test.py`. Testing can be completed with pytest (i.e., pyton -m pytest), and is tested and working on the latest version of Ubuntu desktop.

The second item is a test case for testing SSH connectivity using password and key based authentication; see: `Test Case, SSH connectivity.txt`
